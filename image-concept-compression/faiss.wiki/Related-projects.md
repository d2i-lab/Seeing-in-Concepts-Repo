# Bindings to other languages and porting to other platforms

There are projects to interface Faiss with other languages, see 

- the Rust bindings at https://github.com/Enet4/faiss-rs

- the .NET Core 3.0 bindings at https://gitlab.com/josetruyol/faisssharp

- the Java interface at https://github.com/gameofdimension/jni-faiss

- ruby wrapper here https://github.com/ankane/faiss

- golang wrapper here:  https://github.com/DataIntelligenceCrew/go-faiss/

Other platforms: 

- Faiss is reported to work on Raspberry Pi (see https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/issues/1071) **update** Faiss runs on ARM server machines with Linux.

- Faiss compiles on PowerPC, see issues [#529](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/issues/529) and [#1098](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/issues/1098)

- Faiss compiles on the Apple M1, see [#2111](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/issues/2111). We will soon add this as a supported platform.
